//                  a company handle, so these are only ever polled for
//                  companies a user has put on their watchlist.
//   - 'aggregator' A classical multi-company job board queried without a
//                  handle (keyword/location search). Polled unconditionally
//                  because a single feed spans many companies. No concrete
//                  aggregator ships yet; the type exists so ingestion and the
